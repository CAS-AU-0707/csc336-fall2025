            <li><strong>First to Harness Laughter</strong> – We discovered that children’s laughter produces
                <strong>10x more energy</strong> than screams—transforming the entire industry from fear-based to
                joy-powered.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Sustainable Energy Model</strong> – Unlike other companies stuck in the scare age,
                Monsters, Inc. pioneered a clean, renewable energy system that benefits both monsters and children.</li>

            <li><strong>Cutting-Edge Door Technology</strong> – Our factory houses the largest and most advanced

                masterminds like Mike, we’ve always recruited and trained the very best.</li>

                ensuring a spotless record for both monsters and humans.</li>

            <li><strong>Innovation in Workplace Culture</strong> – We proved that a scare floor doesn’t have to be scary
                for employees. Our focus on teamwork, humor, and growth makes us the best place to work in Monstropolis.

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #FFD54F;"> Meet The Team </h1>
    <center>
        <p style="color: #FFD54F; width: 900; text-align: left;">At Monsters, Inc. we may collect screams — but out goal is to power our
            world
            with creativity, teamwork, and monster-level dedication.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before we introduce our incredible crew, we just want to say: this team is the real scare-force behind
            everything we do. Talented, driven, and always ready to roll (or roar), they make the magic happen every single day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now let’s meet the monsters who make it all possible.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #7AC142"> &#128065 Mike Wazowski – Operations & Efficiency Manager &#128065</h2>
        <img src="mike.png" width="500">

        <p style="color: #7AC142; width: 900;text-align: left;">
            Small in size but larger than life, Mike Wazowski is the unstoppable force behind the scenes. With his
            trusty
            clipboard and boundless energy, Mike makes sure everything runs like clockwork. He’s a master at schedules,
            logistics, and finding solutions faster than you can say “Monstropolis.”
            When he’s not cracking jokes or giving motivational pep talks, Mike can be found keeping Sulley on track
            (and
            reminding everyone who the real brains of the operation is). His humor, optimism, and one-liners light up
            the
            room—just like his big green eye.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fun Fact: Mike insists he’s photogenic… as long as you don’t cover him up with the company logo <a
                style="color: darkorchid;" href="Logo.html">again</a>.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: #4EB4D4;">&#128062 James P. Sullivan – Chief Executive Scare-gist &#128062</h2>
        <img src="Sulivan.jpeg" width="500">

        <p style="color: #4EB4D4; width: 900;text-align:left;">
            With a roar that once echoed through Monstropolis, Sulley has proven he’s not only the top scarer in the
            business—but also a natural leader with a heart as big as his fur. Towering and blue (with the perfect touch
            of
            purple spots), Sulley inspires confidence just by walking into a room.
            <br>
            <br>
            These days, he’s traded in jump-scares for leadership skills, guiding the team with empathy, wisdom, and a
            knack
            for solving problems with both strength and kindness. He’s the perfect balance of powerhouse and gentle
            giant—making sure everyone feels safe, heard, and motivated.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fun Fact: Sulley’s fur takes 231 brushes a day to keep it looking fluffy. Don’t ask how we know.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: #F47CA4;">&#129534 Roz – Compliance & Records Supervisor &#129534</h2>
        <img src="roz.png" width="500">

        <p style="color: #F47CA4; width: 900;text-align: left;">No one slips through the cracks on Roz’s watch. With her
            sharp eye, monotone wit, and
            endless stack of paperwork, she keeps every file, form, and policy in perfect order. She may seem gruff at
            first, but Roz’s attention to detail is what ensures the entire operation runs smoothly—and legally.

            Roz is the master of accountability, reminding the team (in her unmistakable voice) that “I’m watching you…
            always watching.” Behind her glasses and no-nonsense attitude, though, is someone who truly cares about
            keeping
            things fair and square.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fun Fact: Roz can alphabetize faster than a shredder—and she enjoys it.
